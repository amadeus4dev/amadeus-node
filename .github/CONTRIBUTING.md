## Development and Testing

To run the project locally, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/amadeus4dev/amadeus-node.git
cd amadeus-node
npm install
```

### Running tests

To run tests, simply run `npm test` or `npm run test:watch` to keep watching the source for changes and test accordingly.

We are trying to keep 100% coverage, so keep an eye on the `coverage` folder for an overview of the coverage.

### Building the source

To build the source, run `npm run build` or `npm run build:watch` to keep watching the source for changes and build accordingly.

### Using a library locally

To use a library locally as a dependency, simply import or require the `lib/amadeus.js`.

```js
var Amadeus = require('./lib/amadeus');
```

To install your local build into a different project using NPM, first install this library globally, then link it to a new project.

```sh
cd amadeus-node
npm install
npm install -g ./
cd ../your-node-project
npm link amadeus
npm install
```

You can then simply include it as if pulling the library from NPM.

```js
var Amadeus = require('amadeus');
```

### Releasing

To make a new release, follow the following steps:

- [ ] Update the version in `package.json` using semver rules
- [ ] Update the `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version
- [ ] Push all changes and ensure all tests pass on Travis
- [ ] Tag your release in git using `git --tag vX.X.X`
- [ ] Push the new tag `git push --tags`
- [ ] Update the [Releases](https://github.com/amadeus4dev/amadeus-node/releases) tab on GitHub with a new release for the tag, copying the description from the `CHANGELOG.md`

Travis will bow build the package and release it to NPM.
